## Challenge for Developer

A client needs to handle daily jobs trough an list ( TODO LIST ).

Based on this you will need to develop:

- a simple TODO List page;
- it should be possible to filter tasks (one or more);
- it must be possible to order the result by Done / Not Done (asc and desc);

The test should be done in HTML, CSS & JS and we do like if you avoid frameworks. We expect at the end of the test, outside the API running, the following items:

- an gulp simple configuration file to improve development time
- SASS to made easier implement changes on layout
- an explanation of what is needed to make your project work

Remember that at the time of the evaluation we will look at:

- Code organization;
- Maintenance;
- Version control knowledge;
- HTML, CSS and JS knowledge;

To send us your code, you must:

Make a fork of this repository, and send us a pull-request.
